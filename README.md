# BrailleVision
BrailleVision is a Python-based tool designed to translate braille text from images into readable text. It utilizes image processing and computer vision techniques to detect braille dots, create a grid representing their arrangement, and translate the braille patterns into corresponding characters.

Features
Braille Translation: Convert braille text from images into readable text.
Image Preprocessing: Enhance image quality through preprocessing techniques such as blurring and sharpening.
Braille Dot Detection: Identify braille dots within images using contour detection methods.
Grid Creation: Generate a grid representation of the arrangement of braille dots for translation.
User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy usage.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV library
NumPy library
